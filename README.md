Fundamentals Of Power Electronics With Matlab
## **Example 1.1**
### **Description**
  A typical 100W light bulb has a resistance of approximately 144ohm. Find the rate at which energy is absorbed by the bulb when the voltage across it is v(t) = 120*sqrt(2)*cos(120*pi*t).
### **Question**
  How much energy is absorbed by the bulb in 1 hour?
## **Exercise 1.1** 
### **Question**
  Compute the cost to operate a 100W light bulb for 8 hours a day for 30 days if the price of electicity is $0.12 for 3.6 million joules.
## **Example 1.2**
### **Description**
  Find the average value of v_theta=vn*cos(n*theta-fin_n),in which n is a positive integer. The period of the waveform is 2pi/n
### **Conclusion**
  Any sinusoid of any frequency and phase has an average value of zero over one period or any integral number of periods
## **Exercise 1.2**
### **Description**
  Find the average value of v_theta = Vm*sin(theta),theta is between 0 and pi
## **Example 1.3**
### **Description**
  A certain battery-operated dvice reauires 3.0V and draws a current of 40mA. 
### **Question**
1.   What series resistance is required to operate the device from a 12V automobile battery?
1.   How much power is dissipated by the resistance?
## **Exercise 1.3**
### **Description**
  The closest standard value of resistance to 225ohm is 220ohm. Standard resistance walues have a tolerance of Â±5% of the nominal value. If a standard 220ohm resistor is used as the series resistance in Example 1.3.
### **Question**
  What it the possible range of load current?
## **Example 1.4**
### **Description**
  Find the steady-state power absorbed in each element in the circuit shown in Figure 1.2
### **Conclusion**
  In the steady-state circuit, the values of the inductances and capacitances are irrelevant in the computation of absorbed power because the energy delivered by the source is only dissipated in the resistive elements. The analysis of a steady-state DC circuit is only dissipated in the resistive elements. The analysis of a steady-state DC circuit is simplified when all inductors are replaced with short circuits and all capacitors are replaced with open circuits.
## **Exercise 1.4**
### **Description**
  Find the power absorbed in each element in the circuit shown in Figure 1.4.
## **Example 1.5**
### **Description**
  Determine the number of joules in 1KWH
## **Exercise 1.5**
### **Description**
  Find the number of KWHs used by a 2-kilowatt air conditioning unit if operated 9 hours a day for 30 days. 
### **Question**
  Calculate the cost of energy based on 12 cents per KWH
## **Example 1.6**
### **Description**
  Find the average power absorbed in an ideal inductor when the current through the inductance is periodic
## **Exercise 1.6**
### **Description**
  Prove that the average power absorbed in an ideal capacitor is zero when the current through the capacitor is i(t) = C*dv(t)/dt and the voltage across the capacitor is periodic
