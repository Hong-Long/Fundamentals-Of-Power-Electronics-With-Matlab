Fundamentals Of Power Electronics With Matlab
## **Example 1.1**
### Description:
  A typical 100W light bulb has a resistance of approximately 144ohm. Find the rate at which energy is absorbed by the bulb when the voltage across it is v(t) = 120*sqrt(2)*cos(120*pi*t).
### Question:
  How much energy is absorbed by the bulb in 1 hour?
## **Exercise 1.1** 
### Question:
  Compute the cost to operate a 100W light bulb for 8 hours a day for 30 days if the price of electicity is $0.12 for 3.6 million joules.
## **Example 1.2**
### Description:
  Find the average value of v_theta=vn*cos(n*theta-fin_n),in which n is a positive integer. The period of the waveform is 2pi/n
### Conclusion
  Any sinusoid of any frequency and phase has an average value of zero over one period or any integral number of periods
## **Exercise 1.2**
### Description:
  Find the average value of v_theta = Vm*sin(theta),theta is between 0 and pi
