Fundamentals Of Power Electronics With Matlab
## Example 1.1
Description:
     A typical 100W light bulb has a resistance of approximately 144ohm. Find the rate at which energy is absorbed by the bulb when the voltage across it is v(t) = 120*sqrt(2)*cos(120*pi*t).
Question:
    How much energy is absorbed by the bulb in 1 hour?
## Exercise 1.1 
Question:
    Compute the cost to operate a 100W light bulb for 8 hours a day for 30 days if the price of electicity is $0.12 for 3.6 million joules.
